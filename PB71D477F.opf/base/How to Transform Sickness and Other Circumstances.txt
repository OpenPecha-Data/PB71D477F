How to Transform Sickness and Other Circumstances

by Gyalsé Tokmé Zangpo

Namo guru!

This illusory heap of a body, which, like others, I possess—If it falls sick, so be it! In sickness
I’ll rejoice!For it will exhaust my negative karma from the past.And, after all, many
forms of Dharma practiceAre for the sake of purifying the two obscurations.

If I am healthy, so be it! In freedom from sickness I’ll rejoice!When body and mind are well
and at ease,Virtuous practice can develop and gain strength.And, after all, the way to give
meaning to this human lifeIs to devote body, speech and mind to virtue.

If I face poverty, so be it! In lack of riches I’ll rejoice!I will have nothing to protect and
nothing to lose.Whatever quarrels and conflicts there might be,All arise out of desire
for wealth and gain—that’s certain!

If I find wealth, so be it! In prosperity I’ll rejoice!If I can increase the stock of my merits
that will suffice.Whatever benefit and happiness there might be, now and in the future,All
result from merits I have gained—that’s certain!

If I must die soon, so be it! In dying I’ll rejoice!Without allowing negative circumstances
to intervene,And with the support of positive tendencies I have gathered,I will surely set
out upon the genuine, unerring path!

If I live long, so be it! In remaining I’ll rejoice!Once the crop of genuine experience has
arisen,As long as the sun and rainfall of instructions do not diminish,If it is tended over
time, it will surely ripen.

So, whatever happens then, let us always cultivate joy!

In response to a question from a Sakya geshé, asking what should be done in the event of sickness
and the rest, I, the monk Tokmé, who discourses on the Dharma, set down these ways of
bringing sickness and other circumstances onto the spiritual path.

Sarva maṅgalam!
